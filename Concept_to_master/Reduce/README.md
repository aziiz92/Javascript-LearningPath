# Reduce
The reduce() method applies an "accumulator" function that processes each value in a list (from left to right) in order to reduce it to a single value.

[(MDN Definition)](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce).

In more detail: reduce() is a function that is applied to an array and has as parameters a function (transformer) and an accumulator. The result of the transformation will be used as the starting value for the next iteration. The accumulator acts as a start value too.
